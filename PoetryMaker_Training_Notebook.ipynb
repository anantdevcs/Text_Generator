of the time have\\nbeen corrected, here are the first few lines of hamlet, as they\\nare presented herein:\\n\\n  barnardo. who\\'s there?\\n  fran. nay answer me: stand & vnfold\\nyour selfe\\n\\n   bar. long liue the king\\n\\n***\\n\\nas i understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words\\nor letters they had often packed into a \"cliche\". . .this is the\\noriginal meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling\\nto unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions\\nthat look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,\\nabove. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming\\nshakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .\\n\\nthe answer is that they may have packed \"liue\" into a cliche at a\\ntime when they were out of \"v\"\\'s. . .possibly having used \"vv\" in\\nplace of some \"w\"\\'s, etc.  this was a common practice of the day,\\nas print was still quite expensive, and they didn\\'t want to spend\\nmore on a wider selection of characters than they had to.\\n\\nyou will find a lot of these kinds of \"errors\" in this text, as i\\nhave mentioned in other times and places, many \"scholars\" have an\\nextreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a\\nvery high place in the \"canon\" of shakespeare.  my father read an\\nassortment of these made available to him by cambridge university\\nin england for several months in a glass room constructed for the\\npurpose.  to the best of my knowledge he read all those available\\n. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,\\nthat shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a\\nvariety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous\\nfor signing his name with several different spellings.\\n\\nso, please take this into account when reading the comments below\\nmade by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors\\nthat are \"not\" errors. . . .\\n\\nso. . .with this caveat. . .we have not changed the canon errors,\\nhere is the project gutenberg etext of shakespeare\\'s the tragedie\\nof hamlet.\\n\\nmichael s. hart\\nproject gutenberg\\nexecutive director\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\n\\nscanner\\'s notes: what this is and isn\\'t.  this was taken from\\na copy of shakespeare\\'s first folio and it is as close as i can\\ncome in ascii to the printed text.\\n\\nthe elongated s\\'s have been changed to small s\\'s and the\\nconjoined ae have been changed to ae.  i have left the spelling,\\npunctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the\\nprinted text.  i have corrected some spelling mistakes (i have put\\ntogether a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the\\ngeneva bible and shakespeare\\'s first folio and have unified\\nspellings according to this template), typo\\'s and expanded\\nabbreviations as i have come across them.  everything within\\nbrackets [] is what i have added.  so if you don\\'t like that\\nyou can delete everything within the brackets if you want a\\npurer shakespeare.\\n\\nanother thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual\\ndifferences between various copies of the first folio.  so there may\\nbe differences (other than what i have mentioned above) between\\nthis and other first folio editions.  this is due to the printer\\'s\\nhabit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and\\nthen proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then\\ncontinuing the printing run.  the proof run wasn\\'t thrown away but\\nincorporated into the printed copies.  this is just the way it is.\\nthe text i have used was a composite of more than 30 different\\nfirst folio editions\\' best pages.\\n\\nif you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation\\nerrors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel\\nfree to email me those errors.  i wish to make this the best\\netext possible.  my email address for right

waterflie?\\n  hor. no my good lord\\n\\n   ham. thy state is the more gracious; for \\'tis a vice to\\nknow him: he hath much land, and fertile; let a beast\\nbe lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the kings\\nmesse; \\'tis a chowgh; but as i saw spacious in the possession\\nof dirt\\n\\n   osr. sweet lord, if your friendship were at leysure,\\ni should impart a thing to you from his maiesty\\n\\n   ham. i will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put\\nyour bonet to his right vse, \\'tis for the head\\n\\n   osr. i thanke your lordship, \\'tis very hot\\n\\n   ham. no, beleeue mee \\'tis very cold, the winde is\\nnortherly\\n\\n   osr. it is indifferent cold my lord indeed\\n\\n   ham. mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my\\ncomplexion\\n\\n   osr. exceedingly, my lord, it is very soultry, as \\'twere\\ni cannot tell how: but my lord, his maiesty bad me signifie\\nto you, that he ha\\'s laid a great wager on your head:\\nsir, this is the matter\\n\\n   ham. i beseech you remember\\n\\n   osr. nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:\\nsir, you are not ignorant of what excellence laertes is at\\nhis weapon\\n\\n   ham. what\\'s his weapon?\\n  osr. rapier and dagger\\n\\n   ham. that\\'s two of his weapons; but well\\n\\n   osr. the sir king ha\\'s wag\\'d with him six barbary horses,\\nagainst the which he impon\\'d as i take it, sixe french\\nrapiers and poniards, with their assignes, as girdle,\\nhangers or so: three of the carriages infaith are very\\ndeare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate\\ncarriages, and of very liberall conceit\\n\\n   ham. what call you the carriages?\\n  osr. the carriages sir, are the hangers\\n\\n   ham. the phrase would bee more germaine to the\\nmatter: if we could carry cannon by our sides; i would\\nit might be hangers till then; but on sixe barbary horses\\nagainst sixe french swords: their assignes, and three\\nliberall conceited carriages, that\\'s the french but against\\nthe danish; why is this impon\\'d as you call it?\\n  osr. the king sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene\\nyou and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;\\nhe hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to\\nimediate tryall, if your lordship would vouchsafe the\\nanswere\\n\\n   ham. how if i answere no?\\n  osr. i meane my lord, the opposition of your person\\nin tryall\\n\\n   ham. sir, i will walke heere in the hall; if it please\\nhis maiestie, \\'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\nthe foyles bee brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nking hold his purpose; i will win for him if i can: if\\nnot, ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits\\n\\n   osr. shall i redeliuer you ee\\'n so?\\n  ham. to this effect sir, after what flourish your nature\\nwill\\n\\n   osr. i commend my duty to your lordship\\n\\n   ham. yours, yours; hee does well to commend it\\nhimselfe, there are no tongues else for\\'s tongue\\n\\n   hor. this lapwing runs away with the shell on his\\nhead\\n\\n   ham. he did complie with his dugge before hee\\nsuck\\'t it: thus had he and mine more of the same beauty\\nthat i know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of\\nthe time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of\\nyesty collection, which carries them through & through\\nthe most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow\\nthem to their tryalls: the bubbles are out\\n\\n   hor. you will lose this wager, my lord\\n\\n   ham. i doe not thinke so, since he went into france,\\ni haue beene in continuall practice; i shall winne at the\\noddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about\\nmy heart: but it is no matter\\n\\n   hor. nay, good my lord\\n\\n   ham. it is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of\\ngain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman\\n\\n   hor. if your minde dislike any thing, obey. i will forestall\\ntheir repaire hither, and say you are not fit\\n\\n   ham.
